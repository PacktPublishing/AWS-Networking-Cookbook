# AWS Networking Cookbook
This is the code repository for [AWS Networking Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/aws-networking-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123243), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book starts with practical recipes on the fundamentals of cloud networking and gradually moves on to configuring networks and implementing infrastructure automation. This book then supplies in-depth recipes on networking components like Network Interface, Internet Gateways, DNS, Elastic IP addresses, and VPN CloudHub. Later, this book also delves into designing, implementing, and optimizing static and dynamic routing architectures, multi-region solutions, and highly available connectivity for your enterprise.

Finally, this book will teach you to troubleshoot your VPC's network, increasing your VPC's efficiency. By the end of this book, you will have advanced knowledge of AWS networking concepts and technologies and will have mastered implementing infrastructure automation and optimizing your VPC.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapters 01, 02 ,03, 04, 06, 07, 08, and 09 doesn't contain code.

The code will look like the following:
```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd24 php56 mysql55-server php56-mysqlnd
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
groupadd
```

This book assumes basic-level knowledge on Linux operating system and cloud computing.
The book will go through building different networking components in AWS, which may
require a basic understanding of networking and virtualization concepts. If you have an
experience of networking concepts, this is a big plus.
Most of the recipes provided in the book for networking components are provided by AWS
and require AWS console access. For this you need moderate network connectivity to the
internet. Some of the recipes that are executed on the local system are also very lightweight
and can be executed on any laptop or desktop with decent configuration. Sample hardware
or virtual requirements are listed as follows:

* CPU: 4 cores
* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* Disk space: 80 GB

In this book, you will need the following software list:

* AWS Toolsâ€”AWS CLI
* Putty and puttygen
* Internet Browser
* Ansible
* Python 2.7+
* Pip
* EPEL Repo
* Curl / wget
